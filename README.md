# e-commerce-backend

In this project I have used spring boot for writing the backend code and mysql for database.

First create the database in mysql using name E_COMMERCE, then run the project it will automatically create the required table for the application

Once the project run successfully visit this link http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ and you will get the list of api's which are used in this project.
